PLEASE NOTE: At the moment, the application does not connect multiple users to a single centralized database as it is not yet standalone nor made executable. However, in the future there
are hopes to moving the application onto a cloud server that provides such access. Additionally, release does not contain the following features due to time limitation, but hopefully future
release will have all these implemented. 
	-	Set Goals
	-	My Recipes
	-	Dietary Requirements
